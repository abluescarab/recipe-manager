		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		<p>Thanks for using my <strong>Recipe Manager</strong>!</p>
		<p>This recipe manager is simple, fast, and easy to use.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Store recipes with ratings, ingredients, directions, and more</li>
			<li>Simple interface makes it easy to add recipes</li>
			<li>Search through your recipes quickly and easily</li>
			<li>Print your recipes straight from the program</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="list">Recipe List</h2>
		<p>The recipe list is fairly straightforward: you can sort the list by clicking on the headers. You can resize the headers by dragging their edges.</p>
		
		<h2 id="tabs">Tabs</h2>
		<p>The tabs on the right side of the window are where you will be the majority of the time. They include the View tab, Edit tab, and Add tab.</p>
		<p><em>Drag the gray area in the middle of the window (between the tabs and the recipe list) to resize both areas.</em></p>
		
		<h3>View Tab</h3>
		<p>The View tab is where you can view your currently-selected recipe. See everything from its rating to its directions.</p>
		<p><em>Click on the stars to change the recipe's rating.</em></p>
		
		<h3>Edit Tab</h3>
		<p>The Edit tab is where you can edit your currently-selected recipe. Just make your desired changes and click the <strong>Edit</strong> button!</p>
		<p>To clear all the changes you've made without committing them, just click the <strong>Clear Changes</strong> button.</p>

		<h3>Add Tab</h3>
		<p>The Add tab is where you add new recipes. Enter your recipe and click the <strong>Add</strong> button to add it!</p>
		<p>You can also clear all the changes you've made without adding a new recipe by clicking the <strong>Clear</strong> button.</p>

		<h2 id="options">Options</h2>

		<h3>Automatically number directions</h3>
		<p>Everyone writes directions differently; whether you usually include your own numbers or you just write everything on one long line, there's this option to back you up!</p>
		<p>When you're adding or editing a recipe's directions, every new line (every time you hit the Enter or Return key on your keyboard) is a new step. This option, when checked, will automatically number each step in the recipe's directions, so you don't have to worry about it.</p>

		<h3>Switch to the View tab after adding a recipe</h3>
		<p>Some people like to add a bunch of recipes all at once and some people just like to add one at a time. This option, when checked, will switch to the View tab after adding a new recipe; when unchecked, it won't, so you can add as many recipes as you want without having to go back to the Add tab.</p>
		
		<h2 id="printing">Printing</h2>
		<p>Printing a recipe is easy. Just select the recipe you want to print, then do one of three things:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Click the <em>Print</em> button in the <em>View</em> tab;</li>
			<li>Go to <em>File &gt; Print</em>;</li>
			<li>Or press <strong>Ctrl+P</strong> on your keyboard.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Select your printing options, click OK, and your recipe will print.</p>

		<h2 id="backupandrestore">Backing Up and Restoring Your Recipes</h2>
		<p>It's very important that you back up your recipes! Program updates replace the file that holds your recipes, so you should always backup your recipes before updating and restore them afterwards.</p>
		<p>Make sure to keep all your backups in one place so you don't lose them! Alternatively, you can use special backup software to make scheduled backups (anywhere from daily to yearly!).</p>
		<p>Do note that some program updates <em>may</em> change how the recipes list works; in that case, you should still make a backup, but don't restore it once you open the program. Check out the new features and see what you like. Your old backup <strong>will be incompatible</strong> with the new version of the program. I really don't intend to do that often, if at all, so don't worry about it too much!</p>

		<h2 id="errors">Error Messages</h2>
		<p>If you ever receive an error, please let me know! A message will pop up with the error message. You can click the <em>Copy Error</em> button and <a href="mailto:support@abluescarab.us">email it to me</a> or you can click the <em>Send me this error</em> link to open the contact page on my website.</p>
